Conventions for parameters, observables for MC simulations :

* For specific parameters of the Monte Carlo :
Everything upper-case
For expressions with more than one term, use underscore.

Ex : 
EPSILON =1;
NUMBER_OF_WORMS=3;

* Observables :
First letter of each word in uppercase, rest of the word in lowercase
For expressions with more than one term, use a space
For powers of observables, put "^n" where n is the power on the last word

Ex : 
Magnetization
Staggered Structure Factor
Magnetization^2
Staggered Structure Factor^4

* Measurements :
To enable or disable specific measurements, use the keywords 
MEASURE[Observable Name]=1;
TIMESERIES[Observable Name]=1;

Where brackets "[ ]" will be recognized by the parser, and the observable name
uses exactly the convention described before.

Ex : 
MEASURE[Magnetization]=1;
TIMESERIES[Staggered Structure Factor]=0;
MEASURE[Staggered Structure Factor^4]=0;
TIMESERIES[Magnetization^2]=1;
