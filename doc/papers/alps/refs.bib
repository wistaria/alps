  abstract={We show that there is no fermion sign problem in the Hirsch and Fye algorithm for the single-impurity Anderson model. Beyond the particle-hole symmetric case for which a simple proof exists, this has been known only empirically. Here we prove the nonexistence of a sign problem for the general case by showing that each spin trace for a given Ising configuration is separately positive. We further use this insight to analyse under what conditions orbitally degenerate Anderson models or the two-impurity Anderson model develop a sign.}

This way of calculating turns out to be considerably more reliable and accurate than that via the impurity Green's function alone. We give results for the self-energy for the case of a constant coupling between the impurity and the conduction band and the effective arising in the dynamical mean-field theory of the Hubbard model. The implications of the problem of the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model are also discussed.}

  abstract={The four-site "DCA" method of including intersite correlations in the dynamical mean-field theory is used to investigate the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model. At half-filling a gap-opening transition is found to occur as the interaction strength is increased beyond a critical value. The gapped behavior found in the 4-site DCA approximation is shown to be associated with the onset of strong antiferromagnetic and singlet correlations and the transition is found to be potential energy driven. It is thus more accurately described as a Slater phenomenon (induced by strong short-range order) than as a Mott phenomenon. Doping the gapped phase leads to a non-Fermi-liquid state with a Fermi surface only in the nodal regions and a pseudogap in the antinodal regions at lower dopings x[?]0.15 and to a Fermi-liquid phase at higher dopings.}

  number={04},

  year={2004},
  abstract={An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile 'adaptive time-dependent DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.}

  abstract={We present a new method for calculating directly the one-particle self-energy of an impurity Anderson model with Wilson's numerical renormalization group method by writing this quantity as the ratio of two correlation functions. This way of calculating turns out to be considerably more reliable and accurate than that via the impurity Green's function alone. We give results for the self-energy for the case of a constant coupling between the impurity and the conduction band and the effective arising in the dynamical mean-field theory of the Hubbard model. The implications of the problem of the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model are also discussed.}

abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.

It is shown that a rigorous evaluation of the functional is possible for self-energies that are representable within a certain reference system. The variational scheme allows to construct new non-perturbative and thermodynamically consistent approximations. Numerical results illustrate the practicability of the method. },

  Abstract = {Abstract~~We describe current experimental and theoretical understanding of the pressure-induced volume collapse transitions occurring in the early trivalent rare earth metals. General features of orbitally realistic mean-field based theories used to calculate these transitions are discussed. Potential deficiencies of these methods are assessed by comparing mean field and exact Quantum Monte Carlo solutions for the one-band Hubbard and two-band periodic Anderson lattice models. Relevant parameter regimes for these models are determined from local density constrained occupation calculations. },

  abstract={Calculations of ground-state and excited-state properties of materials have been one of the major goals of condensed matter physics. Ground-state properties of solids have been extensively investigated for several decades within the standard density functional theory. Excited-state properties, on the other hand, were relatively unexplored in ab initio calculations until a decade ago. The most suitable approach up to now for studying excited-state properties of extended systems is the Green function method. To calculate the Green function one requires the self-energy operator which is non-local and energy dependent. In this article we describe the GW approximation which has turned out to be a fruitful approximation to the self-energy. The Green function theory, numerical methods for carrying out the self-energy calculations, simplified schemes, and applications to various systems are described. Self-consistency issue and new developments beyond the GW approximation are also discussed as well as the success and shortcomings of the GW approximation.}

Taking into account strong electron correlations in the 5f shell, we show how the equilibrium volume and the bulk modulus are improved in comparison to previous results using the local density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In addition, an augmentation of the orbital moment is observed following Hund's rules, reducing the total magnetic moment. The stability of the delta -phase is explored and for the first time a positive value for the tetragonal shear constant is found.}

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

  abstract={When a local time-dependent perturbation in a metal is switched on and then off, it is desired to calculate the probability P( epsilon ) for the system to be excited to a state of energy h(cross) epsilon . For a strong but slow perturbation V(t) the authors show that the problem reduces to the calculation of an evolution operator for a time-independent one-body potential W(V(t)) which is a functional of V(t). They calculate W for potentials possessing a time-independent phase-shift representation. For such potentials they calculate the evolution operator, and hence P( epsilon ), for a Fermi sea both at zero and finite temperature. They give simple applications of their results to problems such as X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and energy dissipation of an atom scattered from a metal surface. The relationship to a recent solution of the problem, at zero temperature, using a time-dependent Tomonagon representation is indicated.}

  abstract={We introduce a valence bond dynamical mean-field theory of doped Mott insulators. It is based on a minimal cluster of two orbitals, each associated with a different region of momentum space and hybridized to a self-consistent bath. The low-doping regime is characterized by singlet formation and the suppression of quasiparticles in the antinodal regions, leading to the formation of Fermi arcs. This is described in terms of an orbital-selective transition in reciprocal space. The calculated tunneling and photoemission spectra are consistent with the phenomenology of the normal state of cuprates. We derive a low-energy description of these effects using a generalization of the slave-boson method.}

  abstract={In this paper we review recent developments towards a realistic description of the electronic structure and magnetism of correlated nanosystems. A new class of so-called continuous-time solvers for the quantum impurity problem is discussed, which provides a numerically exact solution without systematic errors due to imaginary time discretization. These solvers are able to handle general interactions, like the full Coulomb vertex. We further show how four-point or higher-order correlation functions of the impurity problem can be computed. This allows the calculation of dynamical susceptibilities which provide information about spin excitations. Moreover, we discuss a principally new many-body scheme recently proposed for the description of non-local correlations in strongly correlated systems. This approach provides a basis for a many-body description of extended correlated nanostructures on a substrate.}

  abstract={We investigate metal-insulator transitions in the half-filled Holstein-Hubbard model as a function of the on-site electron-electron interaction U and the electron-phonon coupling g. We use several different numerical methods to calculate the phase diagram, the results of which are in excellent agreement. When the electron-electron interaction U is dominant, the transition is to a Mott insulator; when the electron-phonon interaction dominates, the transition is to a localized bipolaronic state. In the former case, the transition is always found to be second order. This is in contrast to the transition to the bipolaronic state, which is clearly first order for larger values of U. We also present results for the quasiparticle weight and the double occupancy as functions of U and g.}

  abstract={Anderson's pedestrian way of deriving scaling laws for the Kondo problem, known as 'a poor man's derivation', is analysed. It is shown that these scaling equations contain only the first term of a series expansion in powers of the coupling constants. A new formulation of the scaling idea has been constructed to consider higher order terms. The scaling laws obtained in the approximation next to that of the 'poor man's derivation' indicate that for low energies the effective coupling tends to a finite value of the order of unity instead of going to infinity, though no final conclusion can be drawn from these scaling laws as this result may be altered if further terms are also considered.}

  abstract={We apply the functional renormalization group method to the calculation of dynamical properties of zero-dimensional interacting quantum systems. We discuss as case studies the anharmonic oscillator and the single-impurity Anderson model. We truncate the hierarchy of flow equations such that the results are at least correct up to second-order perturbation theory in the coupling. For the anharmonic oscillator, energies and spectra obtained within two different functional renormalization group schemes are compared to numerically exact results, perturbation theory results, and the mean field approximation. Even at large coupling, the results obtained using the functional renormalization group agree quite well with the numerical exact solution. The better of the two schemes is used to calculate spectra of the single-impurity Anderson model, which are then compared to the results from perturbation theory and the numerical renormalization group ones. For small to intermediate couplings the functional renormalization group gives results which are close to the ones obtained using the very accurate numerical renormalization group method. In particular, the low energy scale (Kondo temperature) extracted from the functional renormalization group results shows the expected behaviour.}

  abstract={The authors employ a functional integral approach to the Coqblin-Schreiffer Hamiltonian, similar to that of Yoshimori and Sakurai (YS-1970) for the Kondo Hamiltonian, except that a field lambda enforcing the constraint nf=1 is introduced. By a gauge transformation they show that the phase of the complex sigma field introduced by YS may be absorbed into lambda , leading to a new two-field formulation in terms of lambda and s= mod sigma mod . The static approximation leads to a simple Friedel resonance on the impurity of width approximately TK/N, where N=2J+1 is the number of channels, and whose position is determined by the Friedel sum rule, as in the 'local Fermi liquid' theory. The authors show that the charge susceptibility is zero, is required. Gaussian fluctuation corrections to the static approximation are determined' taking account of fermion propagator renormalisation they then find that the Wilson chi / gamma ratio R=N/(N-1) is correct to order 1/N2. The value of TK is that of a lowest-order renormalisation group treatment, but may be corrected by fluctuation effects.}

  abstract={A new class of high-temperature superconductors based on iron and arsenic was recently discovered (Kamihara et al 2008 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130 3296), with the superconducting transition temperature as high as 55 K (Ren et al 2008 Chin. Phys. Lett. 25 2215). Here we show, using microscopic theory, that the normal state of the iron pnictides at high temperatures is highly anomalous, displaying a very enhanced magnetic susceptibility and a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity. Below a coherence scale T*, the resistivity sharply drops and susceptibility crosses over to Pauli-like temperature dependence. Remarkably, the coherence-incoherence crossover temperature is a very strong function of the strength of Hund's rule coupling JHund. On the basis of the normal state properties, we estimate JHund to be [?]0.35 eV. In the atomic limit, this value of JHund leads to the critical ratio of the exchange constants J1/J2[?]2. While normal state incoherence is common to all strongly correlated superconductors, the mechanism for emergence of the incoherent state in iron oxypnictides is unique due to its multiorbital electronic structure.}

Sampling Feynman's diagrammatic series for the single-particle self-energy, we can study moderate values of the on-site repulsion ( U / t ~4) and temperatures down to T / t =1/40. We compare our results with high-temperature series expansions and with single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field theory.}

  abstract={We present a very efficient solver for the general Anderson impurity problem. It is based on the perturbation around a solution obtained from exact diagonalization, using a small number of bath sites. We formulate a perturbation theory which is valid for both weak and strong coupling and interpolates between these limits. Good agreement with numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo results is found for a single bath site over a wide range of parameters. In particular, the Kondo resonance in the intermediate-coupling regime is well reproduced for a single bath site and the lowest-order correction. The method is particularly suited for low temperatures, alleviates analytical continuation of imaginary time data due to the absence of statistical noise and can be generalized to obtain dynamical quantities directly on the real axis.}

  abstract={A numerically implementable multi-scale many-body approach to strongly correlated electron systems is introduced. An extension to quantum cluster methods, it approximates correlations on any given length-scale commensurate with the strength of the correlations on the respective scale. Short length-scales are treated explicitly, long ones are addressed at a dynamical mean-field level and intermediate length-regime correlations are assumed to be weak and are approximated diagrammatically. To illustrate and test this method, we apply it to the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The resulting multi-scale self-energy provides a very good quantitative agreement with substantially more numerically expensive, explicit quantum Monte Carlo calculations.}

@article{Potthoff05,
Abstract = {The self-energy-functional approach (SFA) is discussed in the context of different variational principles for strongly correlated electron systems. Formal analogies between static and dynamical variational approaches, different types of approximation strategies and the relations to density-functional and dynamical mean-field theory are emphasized. The discussion elucidates the strengths of the SFA in the construction of new non-perturbative approximations but also the limitations of the approach and thereby opens up future perspectives.},

  abstract={We report the temperature dependence of the infrared-visible conductivity of Pr 2 ‚àí x Ce x CuO 4 thin films. When varying the doping from a non-superconducting film ( x = 0.11) to a superconducting overdoped film ( x = 0.17), we observe, up to optimal doping ( x = 0.15), a partial gap opening. The magnitude of this gap extrapolates to zero for x ~ 0.17. A model combining a spin density wave gap and a frequency- and temperature-dependent self-energy reproduces our data reasonably well, suggesting the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in this material and the existence of a quantum critical point at this Ce concentration.}

  ABSTRACT = {The virtual data model allows data sets to be described prior to,
            and separate from, their physical materialization. Virtual data
            products are described by the three dimensions of the workflow that
            must be performed to materialize data sets, the runtime logs
            produced by the execution of these workflows, and the metadata
            annotations that permit application semantics to be associated with
            the data. This model is implemented by a Virtual Data Language
            (VDL) and its supporting processing tools and runtime
            environment. The VDL environment enables the work of deriving data
            products to be spread over a global Grid of storage and processing
            services, and uses both XML and relational data models to capture
            and query annotation, workflow and provenance in this widely
            distributed environment. This paper describes the implementation
            and data modeling aspects of these mechanisms in the context of a
            standardized data provenance challenge exercise.}
