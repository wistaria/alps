Introduction
============
The ALPS project (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) is
an open source effort aiming at providing high-end simulation codes for
strongly correlated quantum mechanical systems as well as C++ libraries
for simplifying the development of such code. ALPS strives to increase
software reuse in the physics community.
